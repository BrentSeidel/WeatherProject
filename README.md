# WeatherProject
Weather Station Project

This is a complete project to use a Raspberry Pi, some sensors, and some servo motors to display temperature, humidity,
and air pressure.  The software will be written in Ada.  This repository will contain the software, notes, and possibly photos of the project.  The is really a demonstration of how to use some of the Ada libraries that I've writen to build a complete system.

Some of the parts should be arriving tomorrow.  I expect to update this when I have time...

To get started:

1. install Raspberrian on a micro SD card and install it in your Raspberry Pi.  I am using a Pi 3 which is overkill.

1. use your favorite package manager to install gnat-gps and i2ctools.
