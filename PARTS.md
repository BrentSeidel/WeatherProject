# Parts List

used.  You're welcome to try substatutions if you're feeling adventurous.

Here's what I used (I got most of these from AdaFruit):

3. PCA9685 16 channel PWM controller (AdaFruit part number 815)

4. 3x SG92R micro servo motor (AdaFruit part number 169)

5. Half size breadboard (AdaFruit part number 64)

6. Assorted jumper wires.
