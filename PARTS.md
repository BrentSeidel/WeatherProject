# Parts List
This is a proposed list of parts for the project.  These are the parts that I
used.  You're welcome to try substatutions if you're feeling adventurous.

Here's what I used (I got most of these from AdaFruit):

1. Raspberry Pi 3 (overkill, I know)

2. BME280 Temperature, pressure, humidity sensor (AdaFruit part number 2652)

3. PCA9685 16 channel PWM controller (AdaFruit part number 815)

4. 3x SG92R micro servo motor (AdaFruit part number 169)

5. Half size breadboard (AdaFruit part number 64)

6. 3x Red LEDs for out of range indicators

7. 2x Green LEDs for activity indicators

8. 5 120 ohm resistors for LED current limiting.  The value isn't critical.  These
are just what I had laying around.

9. Assorted jumper wires.

10. Material for making a case.
